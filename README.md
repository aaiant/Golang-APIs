<h2>Golang-APIs</h2>
- About this Repo: This Repo is dedicated to APIs that I have developed using the Golang programming language, together with the Open Source Gin framework available on GitHub. The APIs are tested directly through the REST extension in Visual Studio Code. Some of these projects include small SQLite3 databases, which allows me to quickly create a few examples of RESTful APIs.
<br>&emsp;Thank you for taking the time to review this GitHub repository. 
<br>I appreciate your interest in my work. ðŸ™‚
